 This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of geomagnetic methods for identifying geological faults and to understand how faults impact magnetic field diagrams. Additionally, the study explores the underlying reasons for magnetic anomalies observed in fault zones. The primary lithologies in the study area are sandstone and claystone, which can contain iron-bearing minerals that influence magnetic properties under faulting processes. By addressing these objectives, the research seeks to determine whether geomagnetic surveys can reliably detect faults, how faults alter magnetic field patterns, and the specific faulting processes responsible for these magnetic anomalies. The findings are expected to enhance fault detection techniques, improve the interpretation of magnetic data, and provide deeper insights into the dynamics of fault zones.
